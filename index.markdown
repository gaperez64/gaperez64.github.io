You have reached my personal website! The information you will find here is
mostly about my (academic) work as a [(tenured) associate professor at the
University of
Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/guillermoalberto-perez/).

## Research
My interests include
* Logic in Computer Science
* Automata Theory,
* Formal Verification, and
* Trustworthy AI (I am a member of the [Ellis society](https://ellis.eu/)).

See [my DBLP entry](https://dblp.org/pid/135/6266.html) for a list of publications.

### What is verification?
Hardware and software systems are hard to design and implement correctly. I
study formal logics that can be used to precisely specify what such systems
are intended to do, and formal models like automata and games to abstract
their behaviour. With my co-authors, we use these mathematical tools to
develop algorithms that enable the verification of systems against their
specifications.

You can also watch a [short video](https://youtu.be/vgFFFUj9sYQ) where I
describe how I ended up studying verification or [this nice video about
reachability and
verification](https://youtu.be/IzSs_gJDVzI?si=Nkv4JFuFy8pWmjeL) featuring some
of my favorite colleagues. You may also enjoy [this fantastic teaser

My research, mostly in the context of formal methods for
trustworthy AI, has been featured in the media too:
* Our "outstanding" AAAI 2025 paper on a decidable class of partially observable Markov decision processes was the topic of two blog posts in Le Monde's [binaire](https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/binaire/a-propos-de-binaire/): [one about the collaboration leading to the paper](https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/binaire/2025/05/09/prendre-des-decisions-optimales-sans-avoir-toutes-les-cartes-en-main-1-2-la-genese-dun-papier-scientifique/) and [one on the actual results](https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/binaire/2025/05/16/prendre-des-decisions-optimales-sans-avoir-toutes-les-cartes-en-main-2-2-la-science-des-revelations/) (both are in French); and [it was also covered by AIhub.org](https://aihub.org/2025/06/24/making-optimal-decisions-without-having-all-the-cards-in-hand/) (in English)
* [Results from Dennis Groß' 2020 collaboration with TNO on attacking models for
  image classification](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2253881-small-sticker-could-hide-a-fighter-jet-from-an-enemy-drone/)
  were featured in an article of [NewScientist](https://www.newscientist.com/)

## Automated Reasoning in Antwerp (ARA)
I am the head of the ARA lab, a
part of the [AnSyMo research
group](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/ansymo/). 

### Current members
* Kevin Dubrulle, co-sup'd with Prof. V. Bruyère (2025-)
* Vanessa Flügel (2025-)
* [Dr. Marnix Suilen](https://www.marnixsuilen.nl/) (2024-)
* [Kasper Engelen](https://kasperengelen.github.io/) (2022-)

### Join us!
If you are interested in joining the team as a post-doctoral researcher, do
contact me. I am particularly keen on supporting [FWO postdoc
fellowship](https://www.fwo.be/en/support-programmes/all-calls/postdoctoral-researchers/junior-postdoctoral-fellowship/) or [MSCA postdoc fellowship](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research/policy/funding/horizon-europe/pillar1/msca/marie-curie/) proposals.

## Tools
I am part of the organizational team for the [Reactive Synthesis Competition
SYNTCOMP](http://www.syntcomp.org/) for which I have developed the tools
[AbsSynthe](https://github.com/gaperez64/AbsSynthe)
and [Acacia-Bonsai](https://github.com/gaperez64/acacia-bonsai).
