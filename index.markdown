You have reached my personal website! Unfortunately, my work-life balance is
not great, so the information you will find here is mostly about my
(academic) work as a [tenure-track assistant professor at the University of
Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/guillermoalberto-perez/).

## Interests
My research interests include
* Formal Verification,
* Logic and Automata, and
* Artificial Intelligence.

See [my DBLP entry](https://dblp.org/pid/135/6266.html) for a list of publications.

### What is verification?
Hardware and software systems are hard to design and implement correctly. I
study formal logics that can be used to precisely specify what such systems
are intended to do, and formal models like automata and games to abstract
their behaviour. With my co-authors, we use these mathematical tools to
develop algorithms that enable the verification of systems against their
specifications.

You can also watch a [short video](https://youtu.be/vgFFFUj9sYQ) where I
describe how I ended up studying verification.

## Research team
I am the head of the Formal Techniques in Software Engineering (FOTS) lab, a
part of the [AnSyMo research
group](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/ansymo/).

### PhD alumni
* [Dr. RaphaÃ«l Berthon](https://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/berthon/)

## Verification tools
I am part of the organizational team for the [Reactive Synthesis Competition
SYNTCOMP](http://www.syntcomp.org/) for which I have developed the tools
[AbsSynthe](https://github.com/gaperez64/AbsSynthe)
and [Acacia-Bonsai](https://github.com/gaperez64/acacia-bonsai). See [my GitHub
page](https://github.com/gaperez64) for a complete list of my tool projects.
