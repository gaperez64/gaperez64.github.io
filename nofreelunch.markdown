The TCS Seminar is meant to expose master's students from the University of
Antwerp to theoretical topics in computer science. You will find below posts
regarding upcoming and past talks given during the seminar. If you want to
attend the seminar, please sign up via the corresponding form so that we book
a large enough room for that talk and buy enough sandwiches for everyone.
