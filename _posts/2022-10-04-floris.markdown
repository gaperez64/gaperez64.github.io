In the last decades, database theoreticians have developed tools to
analyse the expressive power of query languages. The query languages
considered typically target relational, graph or other discrete and
structured data. In graph machine learning, graph neural networks are
currently the technique of choice to perform vertex, node or graph
classification and regression tasks. In this talk we connect database
theory, and query languages in particular, to graph neural networks,
and hereby gain insights in the expressive
power of these networks.

# Speaker
Floris Geerts is professor at the Department of Computer Science. His
research concerns database theory, data quality and graph learning.
