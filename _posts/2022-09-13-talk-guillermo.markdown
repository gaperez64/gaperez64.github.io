David Hilbert's program proposed to ground all mathematical theories to a
single simple system. One of the properties of such a system that Hilbert
deemed desirable was "Decidability". While Hilbert's program was shown to be
impossible to achieve by GÃ¶del (and later Turing), several interesting and
non-trivial theories exist for which algorithms have been found! In this talk,
we will mention some of them. First, we will focus on propositional logic, its
satisfiability problem and its connection to the P vs NP question, as well as
its (previously unthinkable) practical applications. Then, we will mention a
few other theories of interest which are known to be decidable.

This talk is partially based on Moshe Vardi's talk "The SAT Revolution:
Solving, Sampling, and Counting".

# Speaker
Guillermo A. Perez is assistant professor at the Department of Computer
