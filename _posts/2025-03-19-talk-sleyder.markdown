This presentation will introduce the basics of causal modeling and explain how
it differs from probabilistic modeling. Using Judea Pearl’s ladder of causality,
we will show how causal models go beyond identifying associations (level 1) to
reasoning about interventions (level 2) and counterfactuals (level 3).
We will cover structural causal models and causal diagrams like directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs), which help answer “what-if” questions about variables
in a system. We will also discuss ways to build causal models, including using
domain knowledge and methods that learn from observational data, such as
score-based, constraint-based, and functional causal approaches.
To make these ideas concrete, we will provide an example using the LiNGAM
(Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) and share some insights from our recent
research on this model.
