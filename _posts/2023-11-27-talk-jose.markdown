Learning how to localize objects in images without relying on data paired with expensive location-specific annotations is a highly desirable capability. Therefore, it is no surprise that this task, usually referred to as Weakly-supervised Object Localization (WSOL), has received increased attention in recent years. One of the most common problems of weakly supervised object localization is that of inaccurate object coverage. In the context of state-of-the-art methods based on Class Activation Mapping, this is caused either by localization maps which focus, exclusively, on the most discriminative region of the objects of interest, or by activations occurring in background regions.
In this seminar we will touch on the object detection/localization task and its associated challenges. We will further discuss two representation regularization mechanisms that can be applied to address the localization precision problems present in previous methods.
