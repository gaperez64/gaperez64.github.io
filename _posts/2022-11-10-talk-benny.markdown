CSMA/CA networks have often been analyzed using a stylized model that is fully
characterized by a vector of back-off rates and an undirected conflict graph.
Further, for any achievable throughput vector under this model the existence
of a unique vector of back-off rates that achieves this throughput vector has
been proven. In this talk we uncover the set of conflict graphs for which a
simple explicit expression can be obtained for this unique vector of back-off
rates.
