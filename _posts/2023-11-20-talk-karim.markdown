We consider systems of polynomials over a finite field F and are interested in the set of their common zeros. A famous theorem due to Chevalley and Warning from 1935 tells us that, if there are more variables than polynomials, the size of that set of zeros is a multiple of the prime number p which is the characteristic of the field F.
I will give some mathematical context for the interest of this theorem and then discuss some questions (and answers) from modern research related to it.
