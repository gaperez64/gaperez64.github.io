title:  "How to Decompose Planar Graphs"

Planar graphs, graphs that can be drawn in the plane without edge
crossings, are among the most natural and ubiquitous kinds of graphs.
They appear in numerous real-life applications (think of road networks
for instance). They also play a central role in an area of graph
theory called "structural graph theory". For these reasons, it is
interesting to study the *structure* of planar graphs: How can we
decompose them into basic building blocks that are "simple"? What kind
of tricks can we use to solve optimization problems on planar graphs?
This is the topic of this talk. I will start with classic tools from
the 1970s and 1980s such as the Lipton-Tarjan separators and Baker's
decomposition technique, and then move on to some very recent results
in the area obtained in the last 2-3 years. While planar graphs are as
old as graph theory---they were already studied in the 1850s due to
the 4 Color Conjecture---they are not yet fully understood,
researchers are still discovering hidden structures and new theorems
about these graphs today. This is an exciting research area to work in
at the moment. In my talk I will give a gentle introduction to the
area, assuming no background in graph theory.
