Planar graphs, those that can be embedded in the plane without any edge crossings, form a fascinating realm in graph theory with wide-ranging applications in computer science and beyond. This talk provides a comprehensive introduction to the structure of planar graphs, focusing on the fundamental questions of decomposition and the myriad possibilities they unlock.

The session commences with an exploration of the tools and techniques used to decompose planar graphs, shedding light on the intricate nature of these structures. Delving into the heart of the matter, the talk addresses the pivotal question: How can we decompose planar graphs into simpler components? The answer lies in key theorems and algorithms, such as Kuratowski's and Wagner's theorems, as well as the celebrated planar separator theorem.

Having unraveled the secrets of decomposition, the discussion then pivots to the practical applications and insights gained from this process. Attendees will discover how these decompositions pave the way for efficient algorithmic solutions in various domains, including network design, routing optimization, and graph drawing. The exploration extends to the realm of algorithmic graph theory, showcasing how the structural understanding of planar graphs enables the development of algorithms with improved time and space complexities.

As we navigate through this journey into the labyrinth of planar graphs, participants will gain a nuanced understanding of the significance of decompositions. The talk concludes by posing open questions and challenges, inviting the audience to contemplate the frontiers of research in this captivating field. Whether you are a seasoned graph theorist or a curious newcomer, this presentation promises to demystify the intricacies of planar graphs and illuminate the pathways to harness their power in algorithmic design and problem-solving.
