In the world of computer science, combinatorial optimization problems are everywhere: from scheduling classes, finding the shortest path on a map, to optimizing networks. But how can we trust that the solution provided by an algorithm is truly correct? Certifying algorithms offer a fascinating answer. These algorithms not only compute solutions but also produce a certificate—a kind of proof—that anyone can verify independently, even without running the original algorithm.

In this talk, we’ll explore what certifying algorithms are, why they’re important, and how they’re designed for problems like shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and maximum flows. Through simple examples and visualizations, we’ll demonstrate how certification makes algorithms more reliable and transparent, bridging the gap between complex computations and real-world trust. No prior knowledge of advanced algorithms is needed—just a curiosity to learn!
