Query languages are restricted programming languages, which immediately brings up questions about their expressive power and their decidability. Nowadays such questions are less often asked about general-purpose programming languages like C of Python, because the answers for such languages are already well known (e.g., simulating recursion with iteration, or the undecidability of the halting problem). For newer query languages, however, many questions are not yet answered. We give an idea of research on the expressiveness and decidability of query languages by means of the query language SPARQL, a language popular for RDF data in the Semantic Web. This research is still ongoing today, but for this talk we will mainly present some early results from two older papers, from 2014 and 2016.
