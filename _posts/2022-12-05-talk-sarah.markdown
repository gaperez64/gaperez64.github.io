Transducers are an extension of automata. While automata read some input and
in the end either accept or reject the input, transducers additionally produce
some output along each transition that is taken. For example, finite
transducers and pushdown transducers are an extension of finite (state)
automata and pushdown automata, respectively, that additionally output a
finite word on each transition. Transducers are used in many fields of
computer science, e.g., natural language processing, compiler construction,
and synthesis. In order to manipulate transducers, it is important to study
their decision problems. Unlike finite automata which enjoy many desirable
decidability and closure properties, finite transducers do not. Most notably,
equivalence of finite transducers is undecidable. In this talk, we take a look
at different kinds of transducers and explore some of their properties.
