Computers are often used in combinatorics to determine if combinatorial
objects with given structural or extremal properties exist as these existence
problems are often too complex to solve by hand. This is done by designing and
implementing generation algorithms which construct combinatorial objects from
a given class (typically avoiding the generation of isomorphic copies) and
analysing the resulting objects.

In this talk we will give an introduction to computational graph theory and
the design of generation algorithms in particular. We will also give concrete
examples of how these generation algorithms have helped to gain new insights
and solve problems in mathematics and in chemistry.
