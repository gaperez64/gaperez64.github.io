title:  "Parameter Synthesis Problems for One-Counter Automata"

One-counter automata are well-studied classical models in the field of formal
verification that extend classical finite-state automata with a counter whose
value can range over non-negative integers and be tested for zero. The updates
and tests applicable to the counter can further be made parametric by
introducing a set of integer-valued variables called parameters. In this talk,
we focus on the synthesis problems for such automata that ask whether there
exists a valuation of the parameters such that all infinite runs of the
automaton satisfy some omega-regular property. We will discuss how these
problems relate to different restricted fragments of Presburger arithmetic
with divisibility. Using this connection, I will present decidability results
for the above-mentioned synthesis problems. I will also present
polynomial-space algorithms for the special cases of the problem where
parameters can only be used in counter tests.
