# Parameter Synthesis Problems for One-Counter Automata

One-counter automata are well-studied classical models in the field of formal verification that extend classical finite-state automata with a counter whose value can range over non-negative integers and be tested for zero. The updates and tests applicable to the counter can further be made parametric by introducing a set of integer-valued variables called parameters. In this talk, we focus on the synthesis problems for such automata that ask whether there exists a valuation of the parameters such that all infinite runs of the automaton satisfy some Ï‰-regular property. We will discuss how these problems relate to different restricted fragments of Presburger arithmetic with divisibility. Using this connection, I will present decidability results for the above-mentioned synthesis problems. I will also present polynomial-space algorithms for the special cases of the problem where parameters can only be used in counter tests.

This talk is primarily based on joint work with my supervisor Guillermo Perez.
