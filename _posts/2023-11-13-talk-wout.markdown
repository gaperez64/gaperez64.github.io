Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics plays a pivotal role in elucidating complex biological systems by identifying and quantifying peptides and proteins. A central challenge in this field is the accurate matching of experimental MS/MS spectra to theior originating peptides. Sequence database searching has been the cornerstone for accomplishing this task; however, the absence of a ground truth presents significant challenges in distinguishing correct from incorrect peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs).

In this presentation, I will begin by providing an overview of the sequence database searching approach for matching MS/MS spectra to peptides. Following this, I will introduce the concept of target-decoy competition, a robust statistical method for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) during spectrum annotation. This strategy is particularly useful for filtering out incorrect PSMs when a ground truth is lacking.

Lastly, I will describe how semi-supervised learning techniques can be harnessed to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of spectrum annotation. By combining traditional methods with advanced machine learning algorithms, this provides a powerful approach for PSM validation that not only minimizes false positives but also increases the detection of true positive matches.
