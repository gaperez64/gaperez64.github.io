Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a powerful tool for identifying proteins and peptides in complex biological samples. Peptide-spectrum matching (PSM) is a fundamental step in proteomics data analysis, where acquired spectra are compared to theoretical peptide sequences for identification. However, the accuracy of PSM remains a critical challenge, especially in cases where ground truth data is unavailable or limited.

This presentation introduces a novel approach for achieving confident PSM in scenarios lacking reliable ground truth data. We address this issue by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, spectral similarity measures, and data-driven strategies to improve the robustness and accuracy of PSM.
